### Note:
Since some unexpected constraints in my current job, I had not to much bandwidth to fulfilling all the technical requirements, like validations and unit testing. Despite my best efforts, the time constraints and unexpected challenges prevented me from delivering a complete technical test that met all the specified criteria.

On a positive note, I took the opportunity to enhance the UI flow requirements, aligning them more closely with current trends in mobile applications. I incorporated features such as the ability to swipe left for item editing or deletion, aiming to provide a more intuitive and user-friendly experience.

I understand the importance of being in compliance with all technical requirements, and I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by the incomplete submission. Please feel free to reach or give feedback.
